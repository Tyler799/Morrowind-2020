# Morrowind 2019: Thastus Edition

This is an updated, revised and semi re-written version of Cynderal's guide (Morrowind 2017), which was an updated version of Guideanon's 2016 guide, which is apparently a revised version of the Morrowind 2015 guide.

Several developments of new mods or replacements for existing ones have come over the last couple years. Some of these are vast improvements for performance, visuals, gameplay or otherwise. Also, the previous guide had some information that was no longer relevant or true in it.

The 2017 guide can be found [here](https://pastebin.com/B8SqRJtH)

(I retain a copy on HDD of that as well as this version, should you need either. Both earlier versions appear to have been removed from pastebin completely.)

The Reddit post accompanying this release can be found [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/9z641w/morrowind_2019_pastebin_guide_beta_release/)

Finally: You are always welcome to contribute to the guide! We are *not* always in the loop regarding new mod releases, better versions of existing mods, mods that may cause stability concerns, etc. I will be glad to discuss a given mod's inclusion at your discretion.
